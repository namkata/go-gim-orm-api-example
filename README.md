## Introduction

An API to manage notes - allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete notes.
The Notes API is a RESTful service built with Go and Gin framework to perform CRUD operations on notes. It allows users to manage notes by creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them.

## Features

List the key features or functionalities in project.

- Learn about go lang
- Write example restAPI using Gin and GORM with SQLite

## Prerequisites

Specify any prerequisites or requirements needed to run the project. For example:

- Go programming language
- Gin - HTTP web framework
- GORM - Go Object Relational Mapper for database interactions
- SQLite - Database for storing note information

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project locally.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/namkata/go-gin-orm-api-example`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd go-gin-orm-api-example`
3. Install dependencies: `go mod download`
4. ...

## Usage

Explain how to use your project. Include any configuration settings, environment variables, or commands needed to run it.

Example:

1. Run the application: `go run main.go`
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
3. ...
